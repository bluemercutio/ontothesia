    text: "One day the mischievous little hairy men (baboons) met Cagn's son, Cogaz. 'Your father thinks he is so clever, making bows to kill us. We will kill you instead,' they jeered. So they killed poor Cogaz, then tied him up in the top of a tree and danced around it singing. Cagn awoke and sensed something wrong. Using a magic charm, he discovered what happened. He found the dancing baboon-men and ordered them to sing the same song. As they danced, he went behind each one and drove a piece of grass rope into each one's backside with a magical crack. They all bounded off to the mountains, barking and leaping with their hairy tails sticking up behind – thus they became baboons forever. (Cagn then magically revived his son.)",
