He found the dancing baboon-men and ordered them to sing the same song. As they danced, he went behind each one and drove a piece of grass rope into each one's backside with a magical crack. They all bounded off to the mountains, barking and leaping with their hairy tails sticking up behind – thus they became baboons forever. (Cagn then magically revived his son.)",
