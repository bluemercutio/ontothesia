    paragraph: `*Ontothesia* is a project that aims to create novel ways of experiencing, interacting with, and traversing knowledge. The project is one of archiving, mapping and imagining. The core objective of *Ontothesia* is to develop sensational mechanisms through which one can explore cultural hyper-objects in an immersive way. 

*Ontothesia* explores a different conception of AI, not as artificial intelligence, but rather *Alternative Intelligence. By* leveraging language models as *interfaces* to different kinds of knowledge, the project gives viewers/participants a means to experience the contours of some ontological enquiry in a way that is fluid and ephemeral, yet rooted in the provenance and qualities of the source material that informs the enquiry. 

On the surface *Ontothesia* can be regarded as an experiment in *Infinite Cinema* / *Infinite Gallery.* More profoundly it is an exploration of Posthuman Consciousness, cultural cartography, and the inherently pluralistic nature of The Universe.`,

    title: "The Archive",
    paragraph: `At the core of Ontothesia is the concept of the archive and the work of the librarian.  While the end result is a novel immersive engagement with a memetic hyper-object, the latent coordinates of this representation are generated through the curation of cultural artefacts. In this way its representations are neither exhaustive nor extremely particular. Rather, they depict the perturbations and hauntings, the patterned themes, and the semantic & memetic shapes present in the archive. `,
